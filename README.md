# Linear-Algebra-Tools
This is a library that is based on the MATH 136 textbook of the University of Waterloo. In this repo, you will find all sorts of calculation tools that can enhance your experience of learning linear algebra. 

This library is coded using the concepts from CS 136, namely Abstract Data Type and memory allocation. (I feel that this project also demonstrates how useful CS 136 is)

This project is still under development, so please stay tuned for more updates!
