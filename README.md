# Linear Algebra Tools
This library is based on the MATH 136 textbook of the University of Waterloo. In this repo, you will find all sorts of tools that can enhance your experience of learning linear algebra. 

This library is built using the concepts from [CS 136](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs136/), namely Abstract Data Type and memory allocation.

This project is still under development, so please stay tuned for more updates!

**Additional Notes on Each Chapter**

Chapter 1:
- subspaces are omitted because the tools are needed to perform a subspace test are built using concepts from later chapters.

Chapter 2:

Chapter 3:
- Only the 2D rotation matrix is included (rotations in higher dimensions are quite messy).
- Operations on linear mappings are omitted because they are the applications of matrix operations on standard matrices.

Chapter 4:
- Operations on polynomials are omitted because they can be done by writing polynomials in terms of matrices.
